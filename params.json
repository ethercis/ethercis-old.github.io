{"name":"EtherCIS","tagline":"an open source openEHR server","body":"\r\n<h2 class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"65746865726369732c20616e206f70656e20736f75726365206f70656e65687220736572766572\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">EtherCIS (<i>Ethereal Clinical Information System</i>) is an Open Source platform compatible with the <a href=\"http://openehr.org/\">openEHR </a>standard. It is design to allow simple interactions with clients using<a href=\"https://ehrscape.com/index.html\"> </a><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer\">RESTful </a>API and persist clinical data in a separate DB engine. Clinical data are exchanged using different formats:</p><ul><li>FLAT JSON: which is a flatten representation of access path along with the corresponding field value</li>\r\n<li>Canonical XML: representing an openEHR composition in standard XML</li></ul><p>For more details on data representation in openEHR see this <a href=\"https://github.com/handihealth/c4h_sits/blob/master/docs/general/openehr_intro.md\">page</a></p><p></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The core component of the architecture is\r\na persistence engine that leverage new capabilities introduced recently\r\nin several RDBMS in particular the support of relational and <a class=\"wiki_link\" title=\"NoSQL\" href=\"https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/ethercis-support/NoSQL\">NoSQL</a>\r\ndatatypes in the single table structures. Although EtherCIS is flexible\r\nin term of choice of DB, in this implementation, we use <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html\">PostgreSQL 9.4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html\">JSONB </a>datatype.\r\nThis is key feature since clinical data can be used with standard data\r\nquery/mining tools in the context of clinical studies for instance. The persistence layer is using extensively<a href=\"http://www.jooq.org/\"> jOOQ 3.5</a>.\r\nThis library supports various RDBMS and allows very neat SQL coding in\r\nJava. It allows to migrate the persistence layers to suit a target\r\nproduction environment, for example to deploy with Oracle or DB2.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Clinical records are automatically versioned by the platform following an update or a delete. To retrieve a specific version, the request adds a version number to a record id (in openEHR terms, this is done by appending a version number to a composition Id).&nbsp; <br></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Security is an important feature of the platform and compliance with ISO18308 and most national medico-legal regulations\r\n(HIPAA, ASIP etc.) has been a key driver of this system design. Patient data\r\nprivacy, security and controls of accesses as well as auditing user activities\r\nare built-in functions of the platform.. We use a flexible framework provided by <a href=\"http://shiro.apache.org/\">Apache Shiro</a>\r\nsupporting environment specific policies. Depending on the\r\nrequirements, fine grained security accesses can be implemented to\r\nsupport for example a patent's informed consent. <br></p>EtherCIS\r\nimplement a service model based on a component architecture allowing\r\nsimple system modification and fine grained runtime administration via\r\nJMX. The platform can be scaled to larger settings as various mechanisms\r\ncan be used to allow distributed caches to support session tokens\r\nacross multiple instances, database clustering, foreign data\r\nintegration, clinical model caching etc.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
